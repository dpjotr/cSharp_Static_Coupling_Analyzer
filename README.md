# cSharp_Static_Coupling_Analyzer

Console application for the estimation of coupling of classes of C# projects. The application is able to evaluate efferent, afferent, total coupling and coupling factors of total coupling and factors based on implementation of algorythm HITS.

In order to use it, run application and specify path to solution you want to estimate.

At the moment the application has a restriction, it is not possible to use in estimation of coupling of the libraries. Further version is planned to overcome it.
